# MazeRunner

This project focuses on creating a maze for user to play with using keyboard arrow keys, the maze is generated using algorithms, the physics will be generated using Matter.js, the end goal is to generate the maze pattern and move the round shape to the destination.

Challenges are:

Generating maze -----------------> Algorithms, data structure and recursion.

Drawing on the screen -----------> Matter.js to draw maze onto a canvas element

Keyboard control ----------------> Matter.js has the ability to map key presses

Detection of the destination ----> Matter.js has the ability to detect collision between two objects.
